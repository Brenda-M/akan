                <h2>About the Akan People</h2>

              <div>
                <p>The Akan are the largest ethnic group in Ghana living in the Southern regions of the country.
                  The Akans are made up of various dialects that are mutually intelligible.
                  These are Asante, Akuapem, Akwamu, Fante, Akyem, Agona, Assin, Denkyira, Twifo, Wassaw, Kwawu,Bron and Buem.
                  As a meta-ethnicity they share a lot of common traits, but there are various sub-groups
                  related mostly to language and some cultural differences. Many Akan people were taken as slaves and b
                  rought to America, as a result Akan influences can be found in American territories as well,
                   most noticeably in the Caribbean, of which Jamaica has the strongest influences in terms of names.

                <p>
                  One of the most notable aspects of this community is its fairly unique naming system.
                  Children are often named based on the day of the week they were born, and on the child’s gender.
                  So a boy born on a Monday would be named Kwadwo or Koho,and a girl would be called Adwoa.
                  Each day has one or more variants,but there's usually not much to choose from.
                  For instance, the Akans' middle names are usually based on a quality, trait,
                  family member or something else. These days have further meaning concerning the soul and character of the person.
                  Fundamentally, this naming system has as much significance as the assignment of zodiac signs
                   which is prevelant in the western nations. Ultimately, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth,
                   the day they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names.</p>

                  <p>
                    With this knowledge, anyone can determine what their Akan name would have been if they were born in the Akan tribe.
                    By entering your birthdate and gender below, this name generator shall reveal your Akan name.
