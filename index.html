                <p>The Akan are the largest ethnic group  in Ghana living in the Southern regions of the country.
                 This community comprises of different groups all of which have traced a common origin. One of the most notable aspects of this
                 community is its fairly unique naming system.
                 Children are often named based on the day of the week they were born, and on the child’s gender.
                 These days have further meaning concerning the soul and character of the person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Essentially, its is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the day
                  they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names.
                 By entering your birthdate and gender, this name generator shall reveal your Akan name.
